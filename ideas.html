            </h2>
            <p>Spacerace 2.0 has commenced with the advent of privatized space
                companies like SpaceX ushering in the new age with
                reuseable rocket technology. This opens up the outer levels of
                space as a new frontier for commerce and civilization at large. Who
                will have the means to take advantage of first access? Initially
                and speculatively for more than decades to come, only the highly
                privileged will be able. How much more obvious can the gap
                between the super rich and the poor be portrayed than its stratospheric
                manifestation? Time and time again, the collective might of the
                open community has come together to release hoarded power from
                the one or few as to benefit the rest of humanity. With the
                enthusiasm and crowd source of the makers, doers, and FOSS community,
                could the collective once again be able to provide a solution as
                to make space open not for just the privileged few but for all?
